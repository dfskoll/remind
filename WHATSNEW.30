CHANGES TO REMIND

* Version 3.0 Patch 14

+ CHANGE IN COPYING POLICY

- Remind is now distributed under an _AMENDED_ version of the Gnu
  General Public License.  These amendments are listed in the
  file COPYRIGHT.  The amendments were made for personal reasons;
  please don't ask me to explain them.  They probably don't affect
  you, anyway.

+ MAJOR ENHANCEMENTS

- Added an X-Windows front-end to Remind.  To use it, you must be
  running under X-Windows on UNIX, and have the "wish" tcl/tk
  interpreter, version 7.4 of tcl and 4.0 of tk.  The front-end is
  called "tkremind".

+ MINOR ENHANCEMENTS

- Added the WARN keyword for precise advance notice.  You can now
  have advance warning 5, 3, 1 and 0 days in advance (for example.)
  The WARN keyword operates similarly to the SCHED keyword in that it
  calls a user-defined function to obtain the advance warning sequence.

- Added support for QDOS/SMSQ on the Sinclair QL microcomputer,
  courtesy of Robert H. Klein <kleir000@goofy.zdv.Uni-Mainz.de>
  NOTE THAT I CANNOT TEST NOR SUPPORT THIS VERSION!

- Added support for AmigaDOS / SAS/C, courtesy of Martin Hohl
  <martinh@caverna.tynet.sub.org>.  As before, I CANNOT TEST NOR
  SUPPORT THIS VERSION, but will rely on feedback from others.

+ BUG FIXES

- Removed the "-n" option from Rem2PS.  Instead, if you want the
  PostScript calendar to start on a Monday, supply the "-m" option
  to Remind.  It was repugnant to have two options to two programs
  to accomplish one thing.

- The "hebdate" built-in function worked incorrectly with 5 arguments.
  The bug was pointed out by Hershel Safer <h.safer@ieee.org>

- This would hang up REMIND:   REM Mon 31 Feb MSG Foo
  and this would fail quietly: REM Mon 31 Feb 1996 MSG Foo
  Both have been fixed and now report bad date specifications.

+ IMPORTANT NOTE

- I had problems building the DOS version with Turbo C.  I have access
  only to ancient versions of Turbo C and Microsoft C.  Remind built
  fine with Microsoft C, but the TC version hung up.  I am not too
  interested in maintaining the DOS version, so when the MSC compiler
  no longer works, I will drop DOS support.  Please not that I will
  _not_ support MS Windows, and in fact do not allow Remind to run
  under Windows (see COPYRIGHT).

* Version 3.0 Patch 13

+ MINOR ENHANCEMENTS

- Added extra parameters to the "psmoon" built-in function so you
  can annotate the PostScript moon icons.

- Added a command-line "time" argument to Remind for testing Remind
  scripts with specific system times.  Also added the realnow() function
  which has the same relationship to now() as realtoday() has to today().
  (See the man page!)

- Modified Rem2PS so it prints progress messages to stderr if
  '-v' command-line argument is used.

- In the top of the 'finnish.h' file, added a note about
  Mikko Silvonen's file of Finnish holidays.

+ BUG FIXES

- Fixed a bug in rem2ps which sometimes caused incorrect PostScript if
  the -e and -m options were used.  Thanks to Michael Neuhauser for
  reporting the bug and providing a fix.

- Made the '-k' option escape shell characters in the message to make it
  safer.

- Fixed a segmentation violation which resulted if not all
  PUSH-OMIT-CONTEXTs were balanced by POP-OMIT-CONTEXTs.

- Removed the prototype for DestroyValue, which is now a macro.  I'm
  amazed that very few compilers complained about this one!

- Updated the copyright notices everywhere.

* Version 3.0 Patch 12

+ MINOR ENHANCEMENTS

- Added support for the Danish language, courtesy of Mogens Lynnerup.

- Added support for the Polish language, courtesy of Jerzy Sobczyk.

- Made the Makefile more portable, thanks to Jim Budler.

- Removed some compiler warnings under Linux, thanks to Francois Pinard.

- Tidied the man page a bit; added a small bibliography.

+ BUG FIXES

- Fixed a problem with the '-k' option which resulted in a newline being
  placed after the message text.  This was giving sh(1) heartburn...

* Version 3.0 Patch 11

+ MINOR ENHANCEMENTS

- Added release notes to README.UNIX and README.OS2 describing one
  way to make pop-up alarms under X-Windows and Presentation Manager.

- Added the $DefaultPrio system variable

- Improved OS/2 support, thanks to Darrel Hankerson, Russ Herman
  and Norman Walsh.

- Made the pushing and popping of operators and operands during
  expression evaluation in-line code instead of function calls.  Did the
  same for DestroyValue.  I'm not sure if this was a good idea -- on the
  Sparc using gcc, this slowed things down... go figure.

+ BUG FIXES

- Fixed a potential memory leak in the char() function.

- Made the TRIGGER() built-in function return its answer in English even
  for the foreign-language versions -- this was required for compilers which
  are not 8-bit clean, and for languages with accented letters.

- Made expression evaluation slightly faster by eliminating some unnecessary
  copying of string values.

- Corrected some non-portable definitions of the macro UPPER(c)

- Fixed typos in french.h

* Version 3.0 Patch 10

+ MAJOR ENHANCEMENT

- OS/2 support is now much better, thanks to Russ Herman.  The Borland
  C compiler under OS/2 and MS-DOS is supported.

+ MINOR ENHANCEMENTS

- Added the SCHED keyword for precise control of scheduling of timed
  reminders -- it's really quite nifty!

- Modified the trigger() function to take up to three arguments -- in
  addition to a date, you can specify a time and a flag specifying that
  the trigger should be converted from UTC to local time.

- Added $SortByDate, $SortByTime and $SortByPrio system variables.

- Added test suites for MS-DOS and OS/2, courtesy of Russ Herman.

- In PostScript output, the month and year are output in the %%Page: comments.
  Makes it nicer to view multi-month calendars with previewers (eg,
  GhostView.)

- Added the PRIORITY keyword for more control of sort order of reminders.
  Based on a suggestion by George M. Sipe.

- Added the msgprefix() and msgsuffix() evaluations around MSG-type
  reminders for doing fancy things with reminders of different priorities.
  Also added calprefix() and calsuffix() for doing the same thing in
  calendar mode.

- Enabled the -g option during calendar mode as well as regular mode.

+ BUG FIXES

- Fixed minor bugs in the LocalToUTC and UTCToLocal functions.

- "remind -c -de file" used to cause a segmentation violation.  Whoops...

- Some files which should have included <string.h> didn't include it - these
  are now fixed.

- Fixed the moondate() and moontime() functions, which used to be incorrect
  after November 1994.

- Fixed the Finnish language support which was missing a few newlines.

* Version 3.0 Patch 9

+ NOTES

- Remind is now too big to compile under the "small" model in
  MS-DOS.  You must recompile everything under the "medium" model.

+ MAJOR ENHANCEMENTS

- Functions moonphase(), moondate() and moontime() were added for dealing
  with phases of the moon.  The code was snarfed from "moontool" by
  John Walker - see the file "moon.c" for detailed acknowledgement.  Also
  added psmoon() for putting little moon symbols on the PostScript calendar.

+ MINOR ENHANCEMENTS

- Added some more examples to defs.rem - notably, support for ANSI
  terminal color-changing escape sequences, thanks to Gail Gurman.

- Modified both Remind and Rem2PS so that calendars can start on Sunday or
  Monday, depending on your preference.  Unfortunately, the command-line
  options are different -- for Remind, it's '-m' and for Rem2PS it's '-n'
  because '-m' was already in use.  Based on a suggestion by John Plate
  and a patch sent by Mikko Silvonen.

- The Finnish language support is better - now, all usage and error
  messages are in Finnish.  In addition, the Finnish language module
  supports the IBM extended character set as well as ISOLATIN1.
  Thanks to Mikko Silvonen.

- Modified Rem2PS to allow more control over the placement of the small
  calendars, thanks to a suggestion by Frank Vance.  Also added option
  to control the calendar title (e.g., "September 1993") independently
  of day-of-week headings.

- Added the psshade() function to make it easier to shade PostScript
  calendars.

- Allowed a repeat parameter '*num' to be supplied on command line so
  a 'preview' of many days' worth of reminders can be obtained easily.

- Added the $Location system variable.

- Allowed an expression to be supplied to EXIT to return an exit
  status.

- Added the FLUSH command.

+ BUG FIXES

- Fixed the MSF-type reminder to fill paragraphs more intelligently.
  It puts double spaces after '!', '.' and '?', and can handle quotes,
  brackets, etc. after periods, etc.  These characters can be specified
  with the $EndSent and $EndSentIg system variables.  Also modified it
  so that newlines in the body start new paragraphs, rather than being
  swallowed as white-space.

* Version 3.0 Patch 8

+ MAJOR ENHANCEMENTS

- Changed the code to more fully support foreign languages - error
  messages and usage instructions can now be changed.  All changes can
  be localized in the appropriate language.h files.

- Added support for the French language, courtesy of Laurent Duperval.
  Note that the French support is more complete than for other languages -
  French usage instructions and error messages are supported.

- Added support for the Norwegian language, courtesy of Trygve Randen.

+ MINOR ENHANCEMENTS

- Added code for the functions timelocal() and timegm(), courtesy of
  Lucio de Re.  This is for those very few machines whose libraries
  include neither those functions nor mktime().

- Added the filedate() function.

- Allowed the filename to be specified as "-" to cause Remind to take
  its input from the standard input stream.

- Added the "MSF" keyword to cause reminders to be formatted automatically.
  This keyword paragraph-fills reminder text following user specifications.
  Based on a suggestion by Ken McGlothlen.

- Added the "-e" option to Rem2PS, allowing the PostScript calendar
  to fill the entire page.  Thanks to Arthur G. Yaffe.

+ BUG FIXES

- Corrected the Hebrew holidays Tzom Gedalia, Tzom Tevet, Ta'anit
  Esther, Tzom Tamuz and Tisha B'Av so they won't occur on Saturday.
  Corrections made following the algorithm in "Calendrical Calculations"
  by Nachum Dershowitz and Edward M. Reingold.

- Changed the dutch.h language file as suggested by Erik-Jan Vens.  Made
  month and day names lower-case; corrected the spelling of oktober.

- Changed HashVal in var.c to use unsigned arithmetic - it's conceivable
  that a machine with signed chars could cause problems otherwise.

- Changed the LONG_* macros in config.h to LON_* to avoid conflicts
  with names defined by ANSI C.  Thanks to David W. Sanderson.

- Allowed the built-in function char() to accept numbers in the
  range [-128, 255] (but not 0) so that char(asc(s)) works even
  on machines with signed char types.

* Version 3.0 Patch 7

+ MAJOR ENHANCEMENTS

- Added "system variables" to allow the user more control over
  Remind operation, and to allow queries about the command-line
  options from within a reminder script.  They allow for specification
  of longitude and latitude for use by sunrise/sunset calculations.

- Added sunrise(), sunset(), isdst() and minsfromutc() functions -
  these are needed to support sunrise and sunset calculations.

+ MINOR ENHANCEMENTS

- Allowed the MSG, RUN, CAL, PS and PSF keywords to be used in the
  same reminder as the SATISFY keyword.  This makes many complex
  reminders more compact.

- Added the filedir() function to enable Remind's include to emulate
  CPP's #include more closely.

- Allowed non-root users to use the "-u" option.  It only affects
  the "SHELL", "HOME", "USER" and "LOGNAME" environment variables -
  it doesn't change the effective uid and gid when run by non-root.

- Added built-in function "easterdate" to calculate date of Easter
  Sunday - function courtesy of Michael Salmon.

- Improved the Jewish holiday reminders in "defs.rem" to give advance
  notice of holidays.

- Allowed the "simple calendar" option (-s) to specify a number of
  weeks as well as a number of months, in the same fashion as the
  -c option.  Thanks to Dave Rickel.

+ BUG FIXES

- Corrected the behaviour of "hebdate" for jahrzeits; added an additional
  parameter to specify the behaviour of dates in Adar during leap years.

- Changed kall so that "kall sh" doesn't commit suicide - patch courtesy
  of Michael Salmon.

* Version 3.0 Patch 6

+ MINOR ENHANCEMENTS

- Added the PS- and PSFILE-type reminders - these allow you to include
  arbitrary PostScript code in your PostScript calendars.  Useful for
  shading, drawing graphics on calendars, etc.  Use with care, though!

- Added the "-ivar=val" option to initialize variables from the command
  line.  Changed the remind-all.* shell scripts to predefine the variable
  "remind_all".

+ BUG FIXES

- Fixed a bug in the hebmon(), hebday() and hebyear() functions - there
  was an off-by-one error.  Sorry!

- Fixed a bug in the hebdate() function which resulted in infinite loops
  for dates after about 2075

- Fixed a bug in the -u option which sometimes caused a core dump
  (embarrassed grin!)  The fix is due to Tina Hoeltig.  Thanks, Tina!

* Version 3.0 Patch 5

+ MAJOR ENHANCEMENTS:

- Added support for the Hebrew calendar - can now specify Jewish holidays
  easily.  Thanks to Amos Shapir for explaining the Hebrew calendar, and
  to Danny Sadinoff, from whose HEBCAL program I got some inspiration.
  Also thanks to David W. Tamkin and Frank Yellin for explaining the rules
  for jahrzeits.

+ MINOR ENHANCEMENTS:

- Allowed the default page size used by Rem2PS to be selected in config.h

- Edited the defs.rem file to contain Jewish holidays.  Cleaned up some
  of the examples and improved the layout - thanks to George M. Sipe.

- Modified the IIF function to be more general

- Updated finnish.h to support the ISO 8859-1 character set, courtesy
  of Mikko Silvonen.

- Changed the date conversion routines to greatly speed up conversion from
  Julian to yyyy/mm/dd form.

+ BUG FIXES:

- Fixed a bug in which Remind complained incorrectly about a missing quote
  in the command SET foo ""

- Fixed bugs in dosubst.c which caused the %o, %1 and %@ substitutions
  to be incorrect

- Fixed a bug in the man page - thanks to Ed Oskiewicz.

* Version 3.0 Patch 4

- Added the -g option - this sorts reminders by date/time before
  issuing them.  (You can see I'm running out of letters to
  name options!)  This feature was suggested by George M. Sipe,
  Paul D. Smith, and Francois Pinard.

- Added the "args()" and "dosubst()" built-in functions - see the
  man page for details.

- Added more support for the ISO 8859-1 character set, and
  modified the german.h file to take advantage of this, thanks
  to Robert Joop.

- Allowed any character to be used as date and time separator
  characters (not just "/-:.")

- Added support for the Dutch and Finnish languages, thanks to
  Willem Kasdorp and Mikko Silvonen.  (Anyone care to contribute
  French?  Italian?  Spanish?)

- Made Remind issue a warning if you try to redefine a built-in
  function.  This warning is disabled in 'Hush' mode.

- Added the SCANFROM clause to the REM command.  This allows reasonably
  safe moveable OMITs such as the Labour Day example in the manual.

- Added more examples to the defs.rem file, and cleaned up some old
  examples.  Note that there are now safe moveable holidays for most
  U.S. holidays provided in the defs.rem file.

- Added the '-k' option, which allows MSG-type reminders to be passed
  to any system command.  (Idea and patch courtesy of Philipp Slusallek.)

- Allowed selection of ':' or '.' as time separator characters at
  compile-time.

- Edited the COPYRIGHT file to clarify the rules.  Please read them.

- Removed hard-coding of "am" and "pm" and placed them in language-specific
  header files as #defines L_AM and L_PM

- Fixed a bug in the FindToken() routine which had, through sheer luck,
  never been activated until the SCANFROM clause was added!

- Fixed the UNTIL clause to check for a valid expiry date.

- Removed identifiers in the C source beginning with "_" to conform
  to ANSI practice.
  
- Fixed a bug in the -u option which resulted in environment variables
  SHELL and USER not being set correctly.  Also made -u set the LOGNAME
  environment variable.

- Fixed a couple of typos in the man page; added LDFLAGS to the
  Makefile.  (Thanks to Dave Wolfe.)

- Put my new mailing address in the README files.

* Version 3.0 Patch 3

- Corrected bugs in Remind and Rem2PS.  No new features added.  You
  should NOT use patch level 2 - either stick to 3.0.1 or upgrade to
  3.0.3.

* Version 3.0 Patch 2

- Added the -u option to Remind so that root can run it as any user.
  This simplifies the remind-all scripts, and makes them more efficient.
  If you are worried that this option is a security hole, you can
  disable it in config.h

- Changed the RUN command so that RUN OFF can be used anywhere, even
  though RUN ON only works in the top-level file.  This eases the
  management of global files which may want to switch RUN OFF.

- Added ISO encoding (ISO 8859-1) to the PostScript output, courtesy of
  Michael Salmon.  This can be selected with the '-i' option in rem2ps.

- Added support for the '-' date separator as well as the '/' separator.

- Added support for languages other than English.  Note that this support
  is not complete - error messages are still in English.  The idea and
  German translation came from Wolfgang Thronicke.

- Changed the -w option to include the "padding" and "spacing" options.
  NOTE INCOMPATIBILITY:  In the previous patch level, creating a weekly
  calendar using the -c+n option left no blank lines between the day
  number and the first reminder entry.  This has been changed so that one
  blank line is left.  To revert to the old behaviour, use the "-w,,0"
  option.

- Added the -o option to Rem2ps.  This allows you to specify the margins
  when producing a PostScript calendar.

- Updated the copyright notices in all the files. :-)

- Added 'make clobber' and 'make test' targets to the Unix makefile.

- Corrected typos in WHATSNEW.30 and remind.1 man page.  Thanks to
  Dave Wolfe <dwolfe@pffft.sps.mot.com>

- Changed Remind so that supplying the -a option causes timed reminders
  not to be placed into the calendar in calendar mode.

* Version 3.0 Patch 1

- Wrote the Rem2ps program to produce PostScript calendars

- Added an 'install' target to the Makefile

- Fixed a bug which allowed the shell() function to execute in timed
  reminders which were queued with RUN disabled.

- Added support for OS/2, courtesy of DARREL HANKERSON
  <HANK@DUCVAX.AUBURN.EDU>

- In expressions, can now specify literal dates as 'yyyy/mm/dd' rather than
  using the date() function.

- Fixed all the source files to include "config.h" first.

- Changed the way triggers are calculated so that trigger dates are 
  always valid if year, month and day are specified, and there is no
  UNTIL clause.  See MAN page section "DETAILS ABOUT TRIGVALID()."

- Defined _POSIX_SOURCE so Remind will compile on SGI workstations (and
  be more portable... I hope.)

- Fixed some rather brain-dead definitions of UPPER and LOWER, as pointed
  out by <rsalz@osf.org>

- Added more details to the Man page concerning how triggers are computed,
  and added warnings about computing OMIT dates.

- Added the file defs.rem which contains examples of useful definitions and
  triggers.

- Changed the script test-rem to be a sh script instead of csh for improved
  portability.

- Fixed up the README.* files to reflect the changes.

- Re-formatted the WHATSNEW.30 file.

* Version 3.0

- Total rewrite from previous versions

- Added variables, expressions, flow-control statements, daemon mode

- Added "expression pasting"

- Added CAL-type reminders

- Added the SATISFY clause

- Improved debugging of reminder scripts

- Took out the "purge" option - it is in general too dificult to tell when
  a reminder has expired for good, so now it's up to you to do this
  by hand.

- Fixed a lurking bug in trigger date calculation which, amazingly, had not
  been caught in the couple of years that Remind has been out!

* Version 2.3 Patch 5 

- Added the "c+n" option for printing a calendar by
  weeks instead of months, courtesy Dennis Cottel (dennis@peanuts.nosc.mil).

* Version 2.3 Patch 4

- Made the init.c file nicer.  Made the Makefile
  prettier.  Added "make test", "make tar" and "make shar" Makefile targets.

* Version 2.3 Patch 3

- Added a command-line option for Remind to process
  queued reminders in the foreground.  This makes automatic termination
  of Remind processes from within X-Windows and Sunview easier.

* Version 2.3 Patch 2

- Fixed up a problem with timed reminders which resulted
  in cursor not starting from left side of screen on some systems.

- Fixed the SIGINT handler for SYSV systems - this was interrupting the
  sleep(2) system call.

- Closed stdin and stdout if remind was part of a pipe - this prevents other
  sections of the pipe from hanging as remind puts itself in the background.

- Added the "-h" (Hush mode) option

- Added the "%#" and "%@" modifiers for the current time.

- Made the Makefile more portable

* Version 2.3 Patch 1

- Added the "-t" command-line option to get Remind
  to trigger all non-expired reminders.

- Added Turbo C support courtesy of Rhys Weatherly

- Added the "RUN ON" and "RUN OFF" commands for a secure interface with
  the Elm mail system.

- Added the "rem" shell script for running Remind with a default script.

- Added manual pages for "kall" and "rem".

* Version 2.3

- Added the UNTIL keyword for forcing reminders to expire.

- Added the "++" form of 'back' and the "--" form of 'delta' for
  ignoring OMIT information.

- Added the CLEAR-OMIT-CONTEXT, PUSH-OMIT-CONTEXT and POP-OMIT-CONTEXT
  keywords for isolating personal or peculiar reminders from the global
  OMIT context.

- Speeded up the parsing of tokens.

- Changed the source to recognize and exploit ANSI-C compilers which
  accept function prototypes.

- Added the "-n" option to output the next occurrence of each reminder
  in SimpleCalendar format

- Modified the calendar and SimpleCalendar formats so that the % escape
  substitutions ARE performed.

* Version 2.2 - Patch 5

- Added the BEFORE, AFTER and SKIP tokens to make the
  handling of holidays more sensible.  Also corrected a few more bugs.

* Version 2.2 - Patch 3

- Added the MSG or RUN tokens in an OMIT command; also
  allowed RUN-type reminders to be explicitly included in the calendar by
  using the %" escape sequence.

* Version 2.2

- Added the AT keyword, the timed reminders daemon, and the
  calendar facility.

* Version 2.1

- Added the "repeat" token for repeating reminders with a period
  other than 7 days.  Also fixed some bugs from version 2.0

* Version 2.0

- first public release.  Included advanced date specifications,
  character substitution, and the RUN keyword.

* Version 1.0

- never publicly released.
